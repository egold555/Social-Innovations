                            <h1>Death from Disease and the Miracle of Vaccines: A look at Plagues Throughout History and the Modern Cures for Them</h1>
                            <br>
                            <h3>By Eric Golde</h3>
                            <br>

<p>Throughout history as we know it, there have been thousands of infectious diseases. In ancient history, infectious diseases shaped the course of civilizations; with some historians suggesting that diseases were the cause of the decline of certain civilizations<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[i]</a>. Ancient plagues caused tens of millions of deaths in a very short time. In the mid-modern age, while there continued to be scourges of epidemics, a greater awareness of hygiene and a focus on finding cures began to be seen. In modern times, we are still discovering new diseases every day like Ebola, Malaria and the Zika Virus. There is now a growing and greater understanding of diseases and how to cure them.</p>
<p>As once believed, decline of the Roman Empire was not a direct result of the Antonine Plague.<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[ii]</a> The Antonine Plague once believed to be the bubonic plague, may actually have been an outbreak of Smallpox.&nbsp; Many articles claim that over two-thirds of the Roman Empire&rsquo;s population died but that is in dispute, with others suggesting that only about 10% died.<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[iii]</a> An ancient physician and scientist named Galen documented the Antonine Plague and its side effects. Unfortunately, Galen wrote in a way that only he could understand, and did not intend to write it for future historians.<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4">[iv]</a>&nbsp; Galen noted that the plague swept through the army causing mass casualties. He believed that the plague was so contagious because the soldiers all slept in close quarters and shared meals in common areas which led to the sharing of bacteria and germs. Historians have cited that the deaths of so many soldiers was a contributing factor in the decline of the Roman Empire. Without soldiers, the empire was weak and vulnerable against invaders.&nbsp; With the army losing soldiers to illness the defenses of the Empire would be limited. Foreign soldiers also may have brought with them diseases and illnesses. In the country, entire villages and towns were decimated.<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5">[v]</a> Trade was affected, and so many people died, that tax revenues were extremely reduced. In effect, the plague had a financial impact as well. While the exact number of deaths will never be known, historians today believed that those who wrote about the deaths in the time of the Antonine Plague exaggerated the death toll.</p>
<p>Smallpox appeared around 10,000 BC, and spread to Europe in the 5<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;to 7<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;CE. Smallpox spread throughout the centuries until humans got it in the 18<sup>th</sup> century.<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6">[vi]</a> The fatality rate in 18<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Century Europe ranged from 20-60%, and survivors were left with disfiguring&nbsp;scars.</p>
<p>Variola is another term for smallpox. In the 1600&rsquo;s there was no cure for smallpox, but people noticed that survivors of smallpox did not contract the disease again. A technique called variolation, a type of inoculation, was used on people to prevent smallpox.<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7">[vii]</a>&nbsp; It involved transferring a small part of the smallpox pustule to a non-infected person.&nbsp; Variolation was risky because of blood-borne diseases couple with a risk of getting smallpox.&nbsp; However, over time, fatalities dropped by ten times for people who were variolated.&nbsp;<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8">[viii]</a> The process started in Africa, Asia and China and then spread to Europe in the 1670&rsquo;s. In England, an aristocratic woman, Lady Mary Wortley Montague, was a supporter of variolation because a number of family members died from smallpox.<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9">[ix]</a>&nbsp; Working with the royal physicians, they helped the technique gain acceptance.&nbsp; Variolation was also practiced in the United States.&nbsp; Historians estimate nearly half the population of Boston contracted smallpox in a 1721 epidemic.&nbsp; The fatality rate was 14%, but for people who had been variolated, the fatality was 2%. Efforts to protect people from contracting smallpox continued.</p>
<p>An English doctor, Edward Jenner, born in 1749, noticed that a dairymaid who contracted cowpox from cattle did not get smallpox, although smallpox&nbsp;was spreading in her area.<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10">[x]</a>&nbsp; Jenner hypothesized that the virus in cowpox was similar enough to smallpox that if a person had cowpox, then they would not succumb to smallpox.&nbsp; &ldquo;Jenner's work represented the first scientific attempt to control an infectious disease by the deliberate use of vaccination.<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11">[xi]</a>&rdquo; In 1796, Jenner conducted a test of his hypothesis on a small boy which was successful by exposing him to the cowpox virus the boy did not contract smallpox.<a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12">[xii]</a>&nbsp; Jenner concluded that the boy had immunity to the smallpox virus. This was the world&rsquo;s first vaccine. &ldquo;For many centuries, smallpox devastated mankind. In modern times we do not have to worry about it thanks to the remarkable work of Edward Jenner and later developments from his endeavors. With the rapid pace of vaccine development in recent decades, the historic origins of immunization are often forgotten.&rdquo;<a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13">[xiii]</a></p>
<p>The influenza epidemic of 1918-1919 killed more people than the Great War.<a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14">[xiv]</a> Approximately 1/5 of the world&rsquo;s population was affected. Due to the early affliction and large rates of mortality in Spain, the name Spanish Flu became a well-used term to describe this epidemic. All levels of society were affected; the Spanish Flu didn&rsquo;t distinguish by age or socio-economic status. The epidemic came at the end of World War 1, many soldiers were returning from the battlefield with battle wounds and mustard gas burns. Hospitals were already pushed to the limits. This posed many problems because there was a shortage of doctors and medical facilities.<a href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15">[xv]</a> The influenza pandemic circled the globe and basically stopped the world from functioning. The plague came in three waves, from March 1918 until the spring on 1919. The second wave of the three was the most brutal wave; the second plague killed about 50 million people worldwide. <a href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16">[xvi]</a> It is believed that close to 100 million people died from the Spanish Flew worldwide.</p>
<p>Despite advancements in science and medicine, plagues still occur to this day. In 2013 the Ebola Virus broke out in West Africa. The Malaria Virus broke out in 1880, and still continues to kill thousands of people each year. Though the world has come up with new medicine and vaccines that have wiped out some diseases like polio, new diseases like the Zika virus and the HIVAIDS virus baffle scientists. Smallpox is another virus that has been eradicated by vaccines. Even though scientists can cure some viruses, many people die every year from diseases that cannot be cure.</p>
<p>Malaria continues to be a major killer of people every year. While there are many efforts being made to fight this disease it continues to spread because there is no vaccine to fight it. To combat Malaria people in affected countries use mosquito netting to keep from being bitten while they sleep. The development of specialized clothing is also being developed but it is expensive and because of this it has not been a practical way to help the millions of people who are in danger from the disease. There are many organizations including the Gates Foundation that are working toward fighting the disease, especially in Africa.</p>
<p>Today, people need to be prepared to protect themselves from viruses and illnesses. We have seen with the Zika Virus that new plagues can hit at any moment. While the majority of Americans and people in developed countries understand the importance of vaccines, there are many cultures around the world that still have to come around to the idea that vaccines are important. Cultural issues, a lack of trust in Western doctors and accessibility to hospitals or clinics are still problems in some developing countries. Over population and poor sanitary conditions in some countries are also part of the problem for fighting diseases. While vaccines are a major tool in helping prevent illness or death, you have to get people to believe in their benefits and sometimes this can be hard. Vaccines might hurt and cost money, but in the long run, they save lives.</p>
