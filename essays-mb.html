<p>Society&rsquo;s Reaction to Infectious Diseases Throughout History</p>
<p>Infectious diseases are the top cause of death in children and one of the top in adults. They account for 16% of deaths globally every year.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup></a> Infectious diseases do not discriminate by race, gender, or social class. They differ from other &ldquo;social issues&rdquo; because the root is not social. The root is biological and medical. Despite this, society's reaction plays a large role in how we control infectious diseases and how they are spread. Panic and misinformation about a disease can spread faster than infection. There is a clear pattern that can be seen throughout history in the way diseases are spread, the reaction of the community, and how they are treated. Firstly, I will examine the pattern in smallpox, its spread throughout the centuries. Secondly, I will examine the Plague of Athens as an example of infectious diseases in early antiquity. Thirdly, I will examine the Spanish Influenza and the way it was treated with medical advancements. Fourthly, I will examine Ebola and the modern strategies for combating disease. Finally I will draw connections between all my examples and provide a suggestion for action.</p>
<p>Smallpox has existed for thousands of years and affected almost every society. It exemplifies the way infectious diseases spread throughout a population and how they are treated. Smallpox was often spread through improper care of the sick and dead: &ldquo;When smallpox was introduced into a place in which it had not occurred previously, or at least not for many years, so that a large segment, perhaps all, of the population was susceptible.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><sup><sup>[2]</sup></sup></a> As a result, there were large epidemics whenever a new population was exposed to Smallpox. This epidemic would continue until a large enough population had either died or recovered from the disease. After this, Smallpox became endemic, meaning that while there were still cases of smallpox, it did not create the huge death tolls associated with epidemics. Occasional epidemics would crop up over the years: &ldquo;The persistence of such a disease in an endemic state within a human community was possible only if the population admitted a large regular accession of susceptible persons, either by birth or by immigration.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><sup><sup>[3]</sup></sup></a></p>
<p>The first method of treatment to combat smallpox was variolation (or inoculation) which involved taking part of a pustule of smallpox and introducing it into a nonimmune person. This had risks of transmitting other blood born diseases. It was practiced in Africa, India, and China long before it was introduced in Europe (1670). The fatality rate with variolation was 10x lower<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"><sup><sup>[4]</sup></sup></a>.&nbsp; The English aristocrat Lady Mary Wortley Montague was a strong advocate for variolation in Europe because various members of her family died of smallpox.&nbsp; The royal physician tested the procedure multiple times until it gained general acceptance. Rev. Cotton Mather and Dr. Zabdiel Boylston were the champions of variolation in the Americas. Since variolation wasn&rsquo;t generally accepted Mather and Boylston set out to make to convince the population of its safety:</p>
<p>Mather and Boylston used a statistical approach to compare the mortality rate of natural smallpox infection with that contracted by variolation. During the great epidemic of 1721, approximately half of Boston's 12,000 citizens contracted smallpox. The fatality rate for the naturally contracted disease was 14%, whereas Boylston and Mather reported a mortality rate of only 2% among variolated individuals.</p>
<p>Variolation has been used for centuries but vaccination is a relatively new concept. Vaccination involves introducing cowpox into susceptible people as opposed to using smallpox. Edward Jenner popularized vaccination however he didn&rsquo;t invent it.&nbsp; He also provided the first scientific approach which increased the credibility. The significance of using the scientific method is that it eliminates misinformation and made vaccines more accepted in the community.</p>
<p>The plague of Athens was one of the most devastating and memorable plagues in the history of Greece. It killed tens of thousands of people during the the late 400 BC. This is due to both the influence of the plague on the Peloponnesian war as well as the detailed notes kept by the Thucydides<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"><sup><sup>[5]</sup></sup></a>. The plague of Athens struck with such force and had a significant effect on the interactions of individuals in the community: &ldquo;The despair caused by the plague within the city led the people to be indifferent to the laws of men and gods, and many cast themselves into self-indulgence.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"><sup><sup>[6]</sup></sup></a> People were reckless with their money because they didn&rsquo;t think they would live to see the fruits of good investments. This threw the society into turmoil. Without the knowledge of proper medical techniques, doctors often became ill and died.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7"><sup><sup>[7]</sup></sup></a> This combination of factors caused a panic which further prevented the treatment. This combined with the war Athens was involved in with the Spartans meant that the Athenian plague spread past Athens and into the surrounding areas. There were later epidemics of the Athenian plague but the first was by far the worst<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8"><sup><sup>[8]</sup></sup></a>. The Athenian plague follows the pattern of infection seen with Smallpox, and also the overall theme that a lack of information leads to panic and ultimately disruption of social function.</p>
<p>The Spanish Influenza infected ⅓ of the world's population between 1918-1919. It killed around 50 million people, with the highest fatality rate of any influenza before seen<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9"><sup><sup>[9]</sup></sup></a>. The highest death rate was among young adults, which was unique to this strain of influenza.&nbsp; <strong>&nbsp;</strong>Public health officials used a variety of approaches to control the spread of Influenza. They theorized that air transmission was the main cause of the spread. As a result a lot of the ordinances were surrounding avoiding public meeting places. Unfortunately the severity of these measures varied on a city's power to enforce them, making this sort of prevention method spotty.<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10"><sup><sup>[10]</sup></sup></a> Another recommendation, called prophylaxis, included getting lots of rest and staying in order to fight the disease naturally. This had very little basis in scientific fact and instead was based on common perceptions of how to treat previous influenzas:</p>
<p>These treatments, like the suggested prophylactic measures of the public health officials, seemed to originate in the common social practices and not in the growing field of scientific medicine. It seems that as science was entering the medical field, it served only for explanatory, diagnostic and preventative measures such as vaccines and technical tests. This science had little use once a person was ill.<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11"><sup><sup>[11]</sup></sup></a></p>
<p>Public health officials were not as well informed about the cutting-edge science.&nbsp; Instead they used half-formed ideas to try and prevent the spread of diseases. They were not well prepared for the epidemic. &ldquo;It was unfortunate that no steps were taken to prepare for the usual recrudescence of the virulent influenza strain in the winter. The lack of action was later criticized when the epidemic could not be ignored in the winter of 1918.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12"><sup><sup>[12]</sup></sup></a> Influenza devastated American and the entire world. It altered the course of World War 1, killing more people on both sides than actual warfare did. This was due to a reliance on outdated science to prevent the spread of infection as well as a lack of preparedness. Hospitals were equipped to deal with the magnitude of the epidemic and a city&rsquo;s ability to provide actual medical advice or inforce their public health directives lead to the high rate of infection and death<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13"><sup><sup>[13]</sup></sup></a>.</p>
<p>Ebola has existed as since 1976 but was not recognized on a global scale until early 2014, when an outbreak occurred in West Africa. This caused an international panic and response, despite the fact that ebola was only ever widespread in countries in West Africa<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14"><sup><sup>[14]</sup></sup></a>. Despite this $1.62 billion dollars has been raised by western countries through the World Bank Group alone to provide humanitarian aid and send aid workers<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15"><sup><sup>[15]</sup></sup></a>.&nbsp; Unfortunately, given there is no cure for this potentially deadly disease, the health care workers sent to help are often mistrusted: &ldquo;Workers and officials, blamed by panicked populations for spreading the virus, have been threatened with knives, stones and machetes, their vehicles sometimes surrounded by hostile mobs.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16"><sup><sup>[16]</sup></sup></a>&nbsp; This lack of trust actively prevented aid workers from caring for the sick and lead to further spread of the virus. Additionally, misinformation was rampant in affected areas. There was a significant amount of confusion surrounding how ebola spreads and how to treat it safely. Slogans such as &ldquo;Ebola is caused by a virus. Ebola is not caused by a curse or by witchcraft&rdquo; and &ldquo;science and medicine are our only hope&rdquo; were being spread in a hopes to combat this<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17"><sup><sup>[17]</sup></sup></a>. This exemplifies the issues that are still prevalent today when combatting infectious diseases. Public health officials have to combat both the disease and the panic that comes with it.</p>
<p>The medical effects of infectious diseases are not controllable by a society, however the way that society reacts to such diseases plays a large part in the spread or eradication of diseases. Infectious diseases often create panic, especially when there is not a lot of information available or way to treat the disease. This can be seen in the way America news covered the ebola outbreak and the frenzy that ensued, despite the fact that only 2 people in the US have ever died from ebola<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18"><sup><sup>[18]</sup></sup></a>. That panic often affects the way society functions. People can have a blatant disregard for societal rules because they are so focused on self preservation. An example of this is during the Athens plague, when Athenians became reckless with their use of money. The aforementioned examples are the ways infectious diseases affect society, however society also affects the infectious diseases. When there isn&rsquo;t a clear treatment, the panic that is caused by epidemics is exacerbated and people turn towards tradition in order to combat the disease. The public health officials&rsquo; reliance on outdated notions to combat influenza exemplifies the effectiveness of such tactics. Just as people stick to tradition when they are scared, new treatments are often met with distrust. When Edward Jenner popularized the Smallpox vaccination it wasn&rsquo;t immediately accepted and even today there are some who doubt vaccines medical importance. The dual effect effect of disease on society and society on disease means that there is no one easy solution to stop the spread of infectious diseases.</p>
<p>The spread of infectious diseases can only be stopped when we recognize the pattern of how humans react to infectious diseases. Communities and individuals reactions are based on the knowledge they have. Throughout history we can see the effect of these actions and by extension the effect that knowledge has on combatting disease. Misinformation or ignorance is at the root of the panic that leads to ineffective treatment of diseases. Therefore, the first step to combating the spread of infectious diseases is education. Through education we can combat issues such as irrational panic, distrust of doctors, reliance on outdated treatments, and denial of medical science. Additionally education provides building blocks for further medical breakthroughs. While education alone will not eradicate disease, it is fundamental to dealing with disease in a rational and effective manner.</p>
