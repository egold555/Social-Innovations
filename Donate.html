                            <h5><i>Doctors Without Borders</i> is an organization that helps provide medical aid to provide people with health care for those who cannot afford it, are in disasters, or have exclusion from health care. They are located in more than 60 countries around the world. They also provide very relevant, well documented, news articles on their website. The way <i>Doctors Without Borders</i> work is volunteers. Medical volunteers range from those who give basic care like vaccinations, maternal and pediatric care, to surgeons who fight diseases and perform complex surgeries.
                                <br> The people who volunteer at <i>Doctors Without Borders</i> don’t only volunteer their skills to help those most in need, often they put their own lives in danger, as they tend to work in war zones and other dangerous places.Doctors Without Borders is an independent organization that relies on donations from individuals and companies.

                            <h5>The core mission of the <i>World Health Organization</i> is promoting health. The constitution outlines the importance of health and its effects on peace. It also states that health and access to public health resources is a fundamental human right. “Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.”
                                <br> The <i>WHO</i> has been instrumental in containing multiple outbreaks of infectious diseases as providing routine health care. They also have multiple programs to create public health infrastructure. They also have individual programs on different diseases including infectious diseases. In tandem with the programs to treat diseases and viruses there is also a large amount of information surrounding what they are and how they are treated. Specific successes include helping containing the ebola outbreak. Additionally the WHO deals with fundraising and working with countries to make sure their money is used effectively. </h5>
